# NeonAuto

This is a simple script, it will auto run as long as you start it in the right page.
But just in case here's the link for the [**Delivery Page**](https://portal.neondistrict.io/neonpizza/delivery-agents)!

### The instructions are as following:</h3>
  1. Intall the extension
  2. Go to the **[Delivery Page]**(https://portal.neondistrict.io/neonpizza/delivery-agents)
  3. Reload the Delivery Page (if needed)


That's it!
it should auto start, give it a few second. If not just reload the page. As long as it is in the right one it should work!
